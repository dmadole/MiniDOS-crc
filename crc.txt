Name:
  crc - calculate CRC of file

Usage:
  crc -[x|b] path

Description:
  This command calculates the CRC of a file, and can also calculate what the 
  CRC of the file would be if XMODEM padding was added.

Options:
  -x (xmodem) calculates what the CRC would be if the file was XMODEM-padded
  -b (both) calculates both the plain and XMODEM-padded CRCs of the file

Details:
  This version of crc uses pre-calculated CRC tables, which speed the 
  calculation by approximately ten times over fully calculating on-the-fly.
